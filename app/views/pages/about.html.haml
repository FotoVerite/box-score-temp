    Through this website, HS Box Scores NYC is providing a dedicated platform
    to display score data and other statistical information for varsity high
    school basketball, baseball and softball games in the New York City area,
    all at no cost to the schools, student-athletes or website visitors.

    The mission of HS Box Scores NYC is very similar to the mission of Henry
    Chadwick when he invented the box score right here in New York City back
    in 1863: to increase the interest of the games played. HS Box Scores NYC
    will provide each school, coach, student-athlete, as well as friends, family
    and the media, with the ability to closely follow the results of all varsity
    basketball, baseball and softball games of interest. We also hope that our
    website will promote interest in the New York City area from colleges seeking
    to recruit student-athletes.

    Participation in this website is available to all high schools in New York
    City with varsity teams that compete in basketball, baseball and softball.
    We encourage all of these schools (public and private, large and small) to
    take advantage of this free service by promptly and consistently reporting
    score information and the related statistics through our user-friendly password
    protected data entry tool.

    We hope that HS Box Scores NYC will help bolster the attraction and following
    of varsity basketball, baseball and softball in New York City and we are excited
    about the opportunity to stimulate the focus on New York Cityâ€™s student-athletes.
