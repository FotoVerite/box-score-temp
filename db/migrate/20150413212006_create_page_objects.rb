    Page.create(title: 'Frequently Asked Questions', slug: 'faq', content: "## What is HS Box Scores NYC?\r\n\r\nHS Box Scores NYC, LLC is the owner and operator of [www.hsboxscoresnyc.com](www.hsboxscoresnyc.com),\r\na new website dedicated to the display of NYC varsity basketball, baseball and softball box scores.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nVarsity team coaches who register their teams can enter box scores after each game using our\r\npassword-protected user-friendly data entry process. For added convenience, coaches may send us a\r\ncopy of the official scorebook or other stat sheet by fax at (212) 330-7659 or by email to\r\n[info@hsboxscoresnyc.com](mailto:info@hsboxscoresnyc.com) and we will enter the box score on the coach's behalf.\r\n\r\n## How much does it cost to register?\r\n\r\nIt's free for all NYC varsity basketball, baseball and softball teams.\r\n\r\n## Who can participate?\r\n\r\nAny NYC varsity basketball, baseball or softball team (boys and girls – public and private – large and small).\r\n\r\n## How does a coach register?\r\n\r\nBy (i) visiting [www.hsboxscoresnyc.com](www.hsboxscoresnyc.com), (ii) clicking the \"Add Your Team\"\r\nlink/button in the upper right corner of our home page and (iii) entering the basic information in \r\nthe requested fields.\r\n\r\n## Why should a coach register?\r\n\r\nHS Box Scores NYC is seeking to promote interest in varsity basketball, baseball and softball in NYC.\r\nCoaches who register and report their box scores in a timely and consistent manner will give players,\r\nfamily, friends, college recruiters and the media an opportunity to easily monitor and share their team's\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n## How long will it take to enter a box score?\r\n\r\nIf a coach has the official scorebook or other stat sheet in hand, the process should not take long at all.\r\nLike most other tasks, the process is likely to move faster after the coach enters a few box scores and\r\ngets the hang of it. Again, the option of faxing or emailing a copy of the official scorebook or other stat\r\nsheet is always a convenient option.\r\n\r\n## Can a coach report a box score if the opponent is a NYC varsity team that is not registered?\r\n\r\nYes. The coach can still enter the box score for both teams, but without the opposing team's\r\nindividual statistics.\r\n\r\n## Can a coach report a box score if the opponent is not a NYC varsity team?\r\n\r\nYes, but in this case the box score will need to be sent via fax or by email.\r\n\r\n## What do I do if I have a question that is not answered above?\r\n\r\nYou may call us at (212) 330-7681 or email us at [info@hsboxscoresnyc.com](mailto:info@hsboxscoresnyc.com).\r\n\r\n**Participation in our website is optional. We recommend that your carefully review our\r\n[Terms of Service](/terms-of-service) and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) before you enter any\r\ndata onto our website.**\r\n")

We encourage all of these schools (public and private &ndash; large and small) to take advantage of our free service by promptly and consistently reporting score information and the related statistics through our user-friendly password protected data entry tool.\r\nWe hope you enjoy this website and we are excited about the opportunity to expand the focus on varsity high school basketball, baseball and softball in NYC.\r\n\r\n**_HS Box Scores NYC, LLC is an independent company that is not sponsored by or affiliated with any college, high school, AAU program, coaching association or media company._**")

Specifically, this privacy policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you in connection with your use of this website and the ways in which we use and share this information.\r\n\r\n**Please read this notice carefully.** By visiting and using the website located at [http://www.hsboxscoresnyc.com](http://www.hsboxscoresnyc.com) (\"**our website**\"), you agree that your use of our website, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this notice and our Terms of Service. Because the Internet continues to evolve, we may need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, in which case we will post a revised notice of the same on our website and update the \"Last Updated\" date to reflect the date of those changes. By continuing to use our website after we post any such changes, you accept the notice of our privacy policy as modified. It is your responsibility to check this notice each time before using our website.\r\n\r\n_**Score Data and Other Statistical Information Displayed on our Website**_\r\n\r\nAs part of the services provided on our website, we will collect and display statistical information about varsity high school sports teams and student-athletes. This is the same type of information that is customarily provided in newspapers and other publications reporting the results of varsity high school basketball, baseball or softball games and it includes the names of the players. This privacy policy does not apply to any such information; **provided, however,** that in the event a player is under the age of thirteen (13), the provisions below under the section entitled \"Children’s Privacy Statement\" will govern such information.\r\n\r\n_**California Residents**_\r\n\r\nCalifornia Code Section 1798.83 permits users of this website who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

This personally identifiable information will be displayed on the \"Profile Page\" of the school which you represent. As such, this personally identifiable information will be accessible to and may be viewed by the other School Administrators from the same school who submit or are authorized to submit score data or other statistical information through our website. In addition to such access and display, we may use any of this personally identifiable information for any purpose related to our website, including to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our website or the services offered by our website, and to send you administrative notices and other communications that we believe may be of interest to you. We also may provide any of this personally identifiable information to our third party service providers and contractors for purposes related to website administration and other services. Since this personally identifiable information will only be displayed on the \"Profile Page\" of the school you represent, visitors to our website and School Administrators from other schools are not authorized to view such personally identifiable information. However, as set forth in our Terms of Service, although we will take reasonable steps to safeguard and prevent unauthorized access to such personally identifiable information, we cannot and will not be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access to such personally identifiable information.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to have any of your personally identifiable information to be collected, displayed or shared for any of the purposes described above, please submit a specific exclusion request via email to [info@hsboxscoresnyc.com](mailto:info@hsboxscoresnyc.com). Please note that any such exclusion request may result in the suspension or termination of your ability to submit score data and other statistical information through this website.\r\n\r\n_Non-Personally Identifiable Information of Website Visitors_\r\n\r\nWe may also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically as you navigate through this website.

We may use the information collected from you while you are using this website in a variety of ways, including to customize advertising that appears on our website, measure traffic to our website and measure user interests and traffic patterns.\r\n\r\n_**Children’s Privacy Statement**_\r\n\r\nOur website is not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). We take precautions to prevent School Administrators from providing personally identifiable information of children under the age of thirteen (13). If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information of a child under the age of thirteen (13) as part of the services provided by this website, we will delete such information from our records forthwith.\r\n\r\n_**Release of Information in Certain Circumstances**_\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that we may release information about visitors to and users of our website if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service; or (c) to protect the rights of HS Box Scores NYC, its managers, members, employees, agents, representatives or users who comply with our Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we may share or transfer personally identifiable information about School Administrators and non-personally identifiable information about our visitors in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale or in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding.\r\n\r\n_**Storage of Information**_\r\n\r\nAll information on our website is stored within a database to which only we and our hosting services provider are provided access. Although we have implemented security measures that we believe provide adequate protection, no physical or electronic security system is 100% protective and we cannot guarantee the security of our website’s servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.")
